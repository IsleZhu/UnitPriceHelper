## 
UnitPriceHelper is an Google Chrome extension that allows to display the prices per unit for the products on multi shopping sites, including Harris Teeter, [TBD].

Online shopping sites give us more choices of products, but to some extent, this increases the difficulty of selection. Most people tend to buy cheaper ones, but which are cheaper? $18.38 for 48 Fl Oz or $27.49 for 101 Fl Oz? It's difficult to calculate manually. This UnitPriceHelper is a solution to unit price comparation. It calculates the unit prices of products in every category, attaching which to the product listing page and product description page, thus helping costumors figure out each item's unit price.
